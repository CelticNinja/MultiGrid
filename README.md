MultiGrid
=========

A custom responsive framework with no bloat, and extra large screen support.



I once did a project with Bootstrap. I thought "Wow, this whole responsive framework is handy." And then, after a while,
I thought "Only 12 colunms? but… I've got five elements that need to be evenly spaced and take up the whole row."
And then, while live testing, I thought "Why is it switching between 'large' format on my iPad in landscape view, and
then small in profile? Where did medium go?" But it was while hunting through over 6000 lines of non-minified code,
loaded with all sorts of… bloat, that I decided "I need to make my own."

And that's the genesis of Multigrid.


The idea behind MultiGrid is to offer a bit more versitlity in laying out the grids, by offering a simple way to swap between
different grid widths, while reducing the amount of non-grid code to an absolut minimum. MultiGrid is intended for those
not afraid of writing their own style code, and just want something to help with laying out a responsive grid without
having to override a bunch of styles to make it look pretty.
